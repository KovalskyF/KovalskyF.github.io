# My design manifesto

## 01: Design as Honest Manipulation
Flusser says design is manipulation, but it’s not always bad. It helps us solve problems. Design should embrace this, but be clear about its purpose. The function should be simple, while the form can be creative. For example, augmented reality (AR) adds layers to real-world spaces. Its function is clear, like helping us navigate with AR Google Maps, but it makes the experience more fun and engaging.

## 02: Deception Isn't Dishonesty
Design often makes things easier for users by using tricks that feel natural. These "deceptions" aren’t lies; they make the experience smoother. Flusser compares this to using a lever to make lifting easier. An example is skeumorphism in early iOS, where icons looked like real-world objects (like a notepad or calculator). This made new technology feel familiar, even though it was a visual trick.

## 03: Design as an Evolutionary Force
Design is evolving every day. What was new and exciting can become everyday, like ballpoint pens, once a luxury, now disposable. In modern design, simple interfaces like Google’s homepage make it easy to focus on tasks, even though there’s complex technology behind it.

## 04: Simplicity, Not Simplification
Simplicity doesn’t mean stripping everything away; it’s about focusing on what matters. Today’s minimalist designs should serve a purpose, not just look empty. Real simplicity feels effective and clear. As Paul Jacques Grillo said, simplicity isn’t about having nothing. It’s about making sure every detail has a reason to be there.

## 05: Question the Norms
Design can sometimes make things look more valuable than they are. For example, plastic pens seem important but are really disposable. We should question these norms. New trends like ethical design ask us to think about sustainability and privacy, focusing on real value.

## Conclusion
Design always involves manipulation, but it’s about how we use it. It can lead to clarity and help people, or it can be wasteful. My philosophy is to use design to improve people’s experiences and make life better.
