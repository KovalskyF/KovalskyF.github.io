Hi, my name is Filip. I'm a student and app designer based in Prague.
I design apps that bring ideas to life — whether it’s mobile, AR, or education, I’m all about creating intuitive, engaging experiences.

I’m a UI/UX designer with background in graphic design. Currently living in Prague. I love creating designs that feel simple and right. I’ve worked on many projects, like making brand identities, designing a board game, and building the UI for the Prague Zoo app. I want to focus on UI design for apps in the future. Right now, I’m working on web and app projects, creating an AR app for my undergraduate thesis, and working at the Czech IT Academy as a UI/UX designer.
When I’m not designing, I’m either cooking to relax or exploring games like Red Dead Redemption 2 to recharge.
