# When a student team can handle projects like a large development studio 
*Design adventure among elephants*

> "There was no app worth using, so we built our own."  

Zoos are visited by millions of people every year, yet very few of them offer a functional and user-friendly mobile app. When we started researching the market, we were surprised to find that most zoo apps were either outdated, hard to navigate, or simply unusable.  

Only two apps really stood out: the **Singapore Mandai app** and the **Rotterdam Zoo app**. Both provided a seamless experience, interactive maps, and useful features for visitors. But why should only two zoos in the world have great apps?

## The team
That‚Äôs when we saw an opportunity. Along with a small but highly motivated team of student developers under the Czech IT Academy (our average age was just **21 years**), we embarked on a year-long journey to create an app that would not only enhance the visitor experience at **Zoo Praha** but also set a new standard for zoo apps worldwide.

## **3 months and the UI is ready**  
> Designing an entire UI in just three months? Challenge accepted.  

When I took on the responsibility of designing the UI, I knew that speed was crucial. We had ambitious goals and a short timeframe. In just **three months**, I crafted the complete user interface, overcoming several major challenges along the way.

## **The biggest challenges?**  
- **üìç Redesigning the entire zoo map**  
  The zoo provided us with an Illustrator document that they use to print DL flyers. We needed the map as a backdrop for the Seznam.cz map navigation API. Unfortunately, after the first set of tests I found that the whole map was offset by about 3 meters and also the SVG was extremely large and could not be used. So I had to redraw the whole map to use it as a backdrop. Then we started another series of tests, the map was correct, it was positioned correctly, but it was huge. I chopped off everything that didn't need to be there and simplified the curves as much as possible. I went from about 500 kB to 63 kB. Now the map is optimized even for slow phones.

- **üé¨ Creating engaging onboarding animations**  
  Honestly, I hate animation. I can appreciate nice motion design, but I can't do it myself. The brain cells responsible for animation are just not present.
I struggled with this for about a week, I knew we needed nice animations for onboarding and I had to overcome the problem. In the end, despite the fact that animations are not really my thing, we used them and the client was happy with them.

- **üè∑Ô∏è Icon design for clarity**  
  A zoo app has many different categories: animals, events, food stands, and attractions. **Custom icons** were essential to ensure everything was instantly recognizable and easy to navigate.
I designed the missing icons based on photos from the internet. From left: Main entrance, lower station of the cable car, upper station of the cable car

## **We are approaching 20,000 users. And the numbers keep growing**  
> "From zero to 19,000 downloads ‚Äì and counting!"  

Numbers don‚Äôt lie. The Zoo Praha app saw **10,000 downloads within the first three months**, reaching **20,000 by mid-April 2025**. The total revenue of tickets sold in the app is more than 800 thousand crowns, i.e. approximately 35,000 USD. That‚Äôs a huge milestone for a project developed by a student team.

But downloads alone don‚Äôt define success. The **average rating** on both Google Play and the App Store is an impressive **4.85/5 stars**, proving that users appreciate the app‚Äôs functionality and design.
