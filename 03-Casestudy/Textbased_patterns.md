## **When a student team can handle projects like a large development studio**  
> "There was no app worth using, so we built our own."  

Zoos are visited by millions of people every year, yet very few of them offer a functional and user-friendly mobile app. When we started researching the market, we were surprised to find that most zoo apps were either outdated, hard to navigate, or simply unusable.  

Only two apps really stood out: the **Singapore Mandai app** and the **Rotterdam Zoo app**. Both provided a seamless experience, interactive maps, and useful features for visitors. But why should only two zoos in the world have great apps?  

That’s when we saw an opportunity. Along with a small but highly motivated team of student developers under the Czech IT Academy (our average age was just **21 years**), we embarked on a year-long journey to create an app that would not only enhance the visitor experience at **Zoo Praha** but also set a new standard for zoo apps worldwide.

## **3 months and the UI is ready**  
> Designing an entire UI in just three months? Challenge accepted.  

When I took on the responsibility of designing the UI, I knew that speed was crucial. We had ambitious goals and a short timeframe. In just **three months**, I crafted the complete user interface, overcoming several major challenges along the way.

## **The biggest challenges?**  
- **📍 Redesigning the entire zoo map**  
  The original map wasn’t designed for mobile navigation. I had to **redraw everything from scratch**, ensuring that it remained visually appealing while being functional as an interactive backdrop for navigation.

- **🎬 Creating engaging onboarding animations**  
  First-time users needed a smooth introduction to the app. I designed a series of **animations** to make onboarding intuitive, guiding visitors through key features without overwhelming them.

- **🏷️ Icon design for clarity**  
  A zoo app has many different categories: animals, events, food stands, and attractions. **Custom icons** were essential to ensure everything was instantly recognizable and easy to navigate.

## **14 thousand downloads, I didn't make that up**  
> "From zero to 14,000 downloads – and counting!"  

Numbers don’t lie. The Zoo Praha app saw **10,000 downloads within the first three months**, reaching **14,000 by mid-February 2025**. That’s a huge milestone for a project developed by a student team.  

But downloads alone don’t define success. The **average rating** on both Google Play and the App Store is an impressive **4.85/5 stars**, proving that users appreciate the app’s functionality and design.  

The app even caught the attention of media outlets, resulting in several articles highlighting our work and its impact:
