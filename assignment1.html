        <h2>Manifesto</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>01: Design as Honest Manipulation</h3>
        <p>As Flusser writes in his essay, design is rooted in deception. It is an intentional manipulation. But this manipulation is not necessarily negative. It allow us to overcome certain limitations. I think design should embrace its manipulative nature, but it should be honest about its purpose. Function should be transparent, while the form can play with perception. For example, augmented reality (AR) transforms physical space to a new enhanced form. Its function is to enrich the everyday user experience (for examle AR in Google Maps). Function remain simple and transparent - maps get us from A to B, but form is playful and intuitive. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>02. Deception Isn't Dishonesty</h3>
        <p>Flusser`s view: Using a lever to cheat gravity and overcome nature is also a metaphor for design`s capacity to elevate our abilities. Design deceives to make us reach higher, not to mislead. I thing, design should empower users by simplifing complex tasks without hiding reality. Sometimes we use visual cues or microinteractions that "decieve" users into finding product more intuitive. These tricks are not dishonest, they just facilitate a smooth experience. Great example on this is the skeumorphism in first releases of iOS. Icons that mimics everyday things like notepad, calculator and so on. Back in the days of first iPhones this made the "new" technology more approachable, even though it was the deception in visual form.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>03. Design as an Evolutionary Force</h3>
        <p>Flusser`s insight on this is, that design bridges the gap between art and technology. It is the point where culture and function meet, creating new possibilities. This is not just Flusser's idea. The first design school, the Bauhaus, was founded with the same mission. This idea is as old as design itself, so it was born after the First World War. Also, design is a point, where culture and function meets, creating new possibilities. Flusser also speaks about pen as an example of something that was once luxurious in now common and disposable. I think design - same as almost everything else - evolves constantly. What was once revolutionary becomes mundane. Design push boundaries of innovation and simplicity, constantly balancing what is needed and what is new and inovative. Emerging trends like minimalistic interfaces in web design reduce friction, allowing users to focus on tasks without distraction. Just look at Google homepage. The core idea has remained unchanged for years. Despite the technical complexity of Google Search Engine, user experience remains clear. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>04. Simplicity, Not Simplification</h3>
        <p>Flusser argues, that design should be "artful" enough, that anyone can become an artist, but this artfulness doesn`t mean oversimplication. In today`s world, simplicity is a buzzword, but the true simplicity is not stripping everything down, the key is to refine the core experience. In today’s digital landscape, users expect minimalist designs, but minimalism without purpose is empty. Every element must serve a purpose.</p>
        <i>Simplicity does not mean want or poverty. It does not mean the absence of any decor, or absolute nudity.</i>
        <br>
        <i>It only means that the decor should belong intimately to the design proper, and that anything foreign to it should be taken away</i>
        <br>

        <h3>05. Question the Norms</h3>
        <p>Modern design is often a deception of value — plastic pens appear to have worth due to their design, but they are essentially disposable. This concept challenges our understanding of value in design. We must constantly question the norms of the design world. What is considered valuable today may be disposable tomorrow. Emerging trends like ethical design, which questions sustainability and data privacy, challenge us to rethink what value design really brings.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Design is not a neutral act. It is a series of deceptions, but not all deceptions are equal. Some lead to clarity, simplicity, and empowerment, while others lead to manipulation and waste. My design philosophy focuses on leveraging design’s manipulative potential to elevate human experiences, not diminish them.</p>
