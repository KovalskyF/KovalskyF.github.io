# Presentation
## Original idea
I wanted to make presentation just about Figma itself. Give you some tips and tricks. Make a little Figma tutorial. The second "big idea" of that presentation was a fact, that Figma is the only tool, that doesn't bother me. And that gave me an idea. How important good tools are.

## Revised mindmap
The opener at the start of the presentation was a comparison between Figma and my GF. I spent two times more time with Figma than with my GF in the last 12 months. So it got me thinking. Why? 
I made a new mindmap, with key points. How important is distraction free enviroment (also the digital one). With Figma, you can actually focus on work. You are not distracted with the tool you are using. Figma doesn't have long learning curve. You can't hide behind features of that tool.
For me, it is the second most distraction free environment (after the piece of paper). I also wanted to talk about term "Skill gap", the gap between idea and skills that are needed to make the idea real. Skill gap kills creativity. Figma is easy to learn. But it can also create an illusion, that design is easy and everyone can contribute.
