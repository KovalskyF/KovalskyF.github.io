## Figma knows me better than my girlfriend

Figma is not just a tool, it's a lifestyle

**To say:**

Hello everyone!
Thanks for being here.
Today I want to talk about something very personal. Figma.
Because in the past year, I’ve spent more time with Figma than with my girlfriend. Or with myself. Or with any other tool, really. And that's both funny... and a bit terrifying.

### 1485 hours

That's more than with my girlfriend.

More than with my friends.


**To say:**
That’s over 60 full days – three months of non-stop clicking, dragging, renaming frames, deleting, and starting again.
More than with my girlfriend. More than with my friends. More than with anything, really.

### 1485 hours slide 2

| Figma      | Girlfriend |
| :---------:| :--------: |
| 1485 hours | 624 hours  |

**To say**

On the contrary, I spent more than 600 hours with my girlfriend, it has its reasons, she is not from Prague. We can see each other only on the weekend, but anyway I spent two times more time with Figma. It got me thinking. Why? So I made a comparison.

### Pros and cons. Figma compared to girlfriend.

| Pros                                     | Cons             |
| :---------------------------------------:| :--------------: |
| Doesn't argue                            | Didn't find any  |
| Has variables                            |                  |
| Makes autolayouts on demand              |                  |
| Real-time collaboration with zero drama* |                  |

*if your coworker is not a complete ass

**To say:**
Pros: Never argues. Has variables. Auto Layout on demand. Real-time collaboration – with zero drama* (*unless your coworker is a complete ass).
Cons? None.

### Simplicity, not simplification

From Manifesto:
>*Simplicity is not about less. It’s about what matters.*

**To say:**

Simplicity is not about less. It’s about only what makes sense.
Tools shape how we think. And Figma shapes mine in a way that helps me focus.

---

### Tools shape thoughts

How do you design meaningful things with tools that constantly distract you?

**To say:**

- Every click that doesn't lead to a solution is an extra step.
- When you spend 10 minutes looking for the right filter or window, you stop thinking about the idea.
- When you solve keyboard shortcuts instead of functions, you lose flow.

### Train station

Imagine designing on bench in a busy train station...

**To say:**

People around you, the noise, the announcements, the sore back from that awful bench you're sitting on... it's hard to concentrate. That's what using bad tools feels like. Distracting. Uncomfortable. It kills focus.

Design is not only about the result, but also about the environment in which it is created. Even when it's digital.

### Everyday useflow
How it goes:

1. Start project
2. Hit a problem
3. Google it
4. Reddit 2017
5. Comments
6. Tomáš sends a reel
7. Watch it… and another
8. One hour gone
“What was I solving again?”

That's not a joke. That's typical wednesday.
Focusing on the work is the biggest challenge of them all.
Focus is not a given. But a good tool doesn't take it away.

### Why good tools matter

Good tools make you better — not because they’re pro, but because they don’t get in the way.

**To say:**

Because good tools don’t make you better by being “pro.” They make you better by getting out of the way.

### What I’ve learned in Figma

Components ≠ just symbols - they are relations

Variants → you learn to think in scenarios

Auto layout → understand what adaptability means

Comments → learn how to communicate clearly

---

### False value vs. real value
Looks good ≠ is good

**To say:**

One of the things Figma really taught me is to know the difference between what looks good... and what is good.

It takes a few hours to learn, In Figma, you can’t hide behind fancy effects. It either works or it doesn’t.

---

### Iterations, iterations...
In Figma, deleting your project is no big deal.
Delete the whole file and start again. Explore. Experiment. Play.
In Unreal, Cinema4D or Illustrator? That’s a mini existential crisis.

**To say:**

I often find that when I use software that has a much longer learning curve (like Unreal Engine, Cinema4D, or Adobe software), I stop focusing on whether the work is actually good.

And also you don't want to redo those things because you're kind of proud that you've at least done that.

That's not gonna happen in Figma. You can delete the whole project and it doesn't matter.

Because it's not a problem to finish a new and better version, because it's easy to do and also pretty quick.

### The skill gap trap
Great idea.
No clue how to make it real.
— The curse of every design student

**To say**

Many designers sometimes find themselves between two worlds:
they have a great idea... and no way to execute it.

They have a great idea in their head.

But then they open After Effects. Or Illustrator.
And the idea starts getting lost in layers and masks and windows.

Skill gap kills creativity.
Not because of laziness. It's the barriers.

In Figma, you can play. The only limit is your own imagination. And if you do run into the problem that you just can't do it in Figma? There's probably a plugin for that.

### The Figma illusion
>Just because I know how to use a lawnmower doesn't make me a landscaper.

**To say:**

But… beware the Figma illusion.
Just because you can click around, doesn’t mean you can design.
Design is not about what one likes. It’s about what works.

Figma is great because it's accessible.
But sometimes that's where its greatest risk lies.

Figma gives the impression that design is easy.

It makes people on the team feel like they can intervene - even if they don't understand it.

It's not a question of ego. It's a question of experience.

Too often design feels like a space where everyone can contribute - but not everyone should be making decisions.

And while Figma looks simple, making design decisions is not.

### Last slide

So thanks for joining me on this little design therapy session.

After years of using complex tools, I realized the best tool is the one that doesn’t get in the way.
