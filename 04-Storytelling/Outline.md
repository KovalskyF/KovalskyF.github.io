## Figma knows me better than my girlfriend

Figma is not just a tool, it's a lifestyle

**To say:**

I've spent more time with Figma in the last year than I have with my girlfriend. Or myself. And certainly more than any other tool.

### Slide 2

That's more than with my girlfriend.

More than with my friends.

### 1485 hours slide 2

| Figma      | Girlfriend |
| :---------:| :--------: |
| 1485 hours | 624 hours  |

**To say**

That's over 60 days. Two months of nonstop clicking, scrolling, deleting and thinking. And yeah, I did the math. Roughly 4.5 hours a day, 11 months straight (without holidays, sick days and so on).

| Has variables                            |                  |
| Makes autolayouts on demand              |                  |

### Simplicity, not simplification

From Manifesto:
>*Simplicity is not about less. It’s about what matters.*

**To say:**

Why am I such an advocate of Figma? I wrote in the manifesto that true simplicity is not about having less, but about having only what makes sense. And that's what I learned in my year at Figma.

### Tools shape thoughts

How do you design meaningful things with tools that constantly distract you?

**To say:**

- Every click that doesn't lead to a solution is an extra step.
- When you spend 10 minutes looking for the right filter or window, you stop thinking about the idea.
- When you solve keyboard shortcuts instead of functions, you lose flow.

### Train station

Imagine designing on bench in a busy train station...

**To say:**

People around you, the noise, the announcements, the sore back from that awful bench you're sitting on... it's hard to concentrate. And that's how I feel sometimes with tools that make my job harder rather than easier.

Design is not only about the result, but also about the environment in which it is created. Even when it's digital.

### Everyday useflow

[Working on a project] -> [Encounter a problem] -> [Want to solve a problem] -> [Start Googling the solution] -> [Opens a Reddit thread from 2017 mentioning the problem] -> [Starts reading the comments] -> [Suddenly getting offtopic] -> [Notification from Tomáš - sent a reel on Instagram] -> [Watch a reel] -> [another, another ...] -> [One hour gone] -> [What was I solving again?] -> back to start

**To say:**

That's not a joke. That's typical wednesday.

---

### Focusing on the work is the biggest challange of them all.

**To say:**

Focus is not a given. But a good tool doesn't take it away. On the contrary.

---

### Why good tool matter

Good tools make you better — not because they’re pro, but because they don’t get in the way.

**To say:**

With the right tools, you'll become a better designer. Not because they're more "pro", but because they don't distract you and you can focus better on what you do. And because of that, you learn more in less time.

### What I’ve learned in Figma

Components ≠ just symbols - they are relations

Variants → you learn to think in scenarios

Auto layout → understand what adaptability means

Comments → learn how to communicate clearly

---

### False value vs. real value
Looks good ≠ is good

**To say:**

One of the things Figma really taught me is to know the difference between what looks good... and what is good.

- In Figma, you can't hide behind complexity.
- It takes a few hours to learn - and then you have no choice but to deal with the content.
- You don't fake "value" with effects, layers or complex tools.
- Either it works or it doesn't.

---

### Iterations, iterations...
In Figma, deleting your project is no big deal.
In Unreal, Cinema4D or Illustrator? That’s a mini existential crisis.

**To say:**

I often find that when I use software that has a much longer learning curve (like Unreal Engine, Cinema4D, or Adobe software), I stop focusing on whether the work is actually good. And also you don't want to redo those things because you're kind of proud that you've at least done that. That's not gonna happen in Figma. You can delete the whole project and it doesn't matter. Because it's not a problem to finish a new and better version, because it's easy to do and also pretty quick.

### The skill gap trap
Great idea.
No clue how to make it real.
— The curse of every design student

**To say**

Many designers sometimes find themselves between two worlds:
they have a great idea... and no way to execute it.

They have a great idea in their head.

But then they open After Effects. Or Illustrator.
And the idea starts getting lost in layers and masks and windows.

Skill gap kills creativity.
Not because of laziness. It's the barriers.

In Figma, you can iterate and iterate. The only limit is your own imagination. And if you do run into the problem that you just can't do it in Figma? There's probably a plugin for that.

### The Figma illusion
>Just because I know how to use a lawnmower doesn't make me a landscaper.

**To say:**

Figma is great because it's accessible.
But sometimes that's where its greatest risk lies.

Figma gives the impression that design is easy.

It makes people on the team feel like they can intervene - even if they don't understand it.

It's not a question of ego. It's a question of experience.

Too often design feels like a space where everyone can contribute - but not everyone should be making decisions.

Design is not about what one likes. It's about what works.

And while Figma looks simple, making design decisions is not.

### Last slide
Thank you for accompanying me on my journey of testimony about frustration with tools, feigned simplicity, and unexpected love for Figma.

Maybe it was a little therapy...

...but at least I didn't have to pay $50 a month for Adobe.
