That's more than with my girlfriend.

More than with my friends.

### Slide 6
**Why am I such an advocate of Figma?**

>From Manifesto: Simplicity, not simplification
>I wrote in the manifesto that true simplicity is not about having less, but about having only what makes sense. And that's what I learned in my year at Figma.

### Slide 7
**Tools shape thoughts**

How do you want to do design that makes sense,
when you're using tools that keep distracting you?

- Every click that doesn't lead to a solution is an extra step.
- When you spend 10 minutes looking for the right filter or window, you stop thinking about the user.
- When you solve keyboard shortcuts instead of functions, you lose flow.

### Slide 8
**Train station**

Imagine designing on bench in a busy train station where you are constantly interrupted because someone comes to sit next to you. Your back hurts because the bench is so uncomfortable. You probably won't get much done either.

Design is not only about the result, but also about the environment in which it is created. Even when it's digital.

### Slide 9

[Working on a project] -> [Encounter a problem] -> [Want to solve a problem] -> [Start Googling the solution] -> [Opens a Reddit thread from 2017 mentioning the problem] -> [Starts reading the comments] -> [Suddenly getting offtopic] -> [Notification from Tomáš - sent a reel on Instagram] -> [Watch a reel] -> [another, another ...] -> [One hour gone] -> [What was I solving again?] -> back to start

### Slide 10
**Focusing on the work is the biggest challange of them all.**

### Slide 11
With the right tools, you'll become a better designer. Not because they're more "pro", but because they don't distract you and you can focus better on what you do. And because of that, you learn more in less time.

### Slide 12
**Things I learned with Figma**

Components ≠ just symbols - they are relations

Variants → you learn to think in scenarios

Auto layout → understand what adaptability means

Comments → learn how to communicate clearly

### Slide 13
One of the things Figma really taught me is to know the difference between what looks good... and what is good.

- In Figma, you can't hide behind complexity.
- It takes a few hours to learn - and then you have no choice but to deal with the content.
- You don't fake "value" with effects, layers or complex tools.
- Either it works or it doesn't.

### Slide 14
**Iterations, iterations...**

I often find that when I use software that has a much longer learning curve (like Unreal Engine, Cinema4D, or Adobe software), I stop focusing on whether the work is actually good. And also you don't want to redo those things because you're kind of proud that you've at least done that. That's not gonna happen in Figma. You can delete the whole project and it doesn't matter. Because it's not a problem to finish a new and better version, because it's easy to do and also pretty quick.

### Slide 15
**Iterations, iterations...**

In Cinema4D or Unreal Engine, you think twice about deleting something. In Figma? I'll delete the whole file. Why? Because I know I can do it again - and better.

### Slide 16
**The skill gap trap**

Many designers sometimes find themselves between two worlds:
they have a great idea... and no way to execute it.

They have a great idea in their head.

But then they open After Effects. Or Illustrator.
And the idea starts getting lost in layers and masks and windows.

Skill gap kills creativity.
Not because of laziness. It's the barriers.

### Slide 17
**Why is Figma different?**

You can iterate and iterate. The only limit is your own imagination. And if you do run into the problem that you just can't do it in Figma? There's probably a plugin for that.

### Slide 18
**Figma illusion**

>Just because I know how to use a lawnmower doesn't make me a landscaper.

Figma is great because it's accessible.
But sometimes that's where its greatest risk lies.

Figma gives the impression that design is easy.

It makes people on the team feel like they can intervene - even if they don't understand it.

It's not a question of ego. It's a question of experience.

Too often design feels like a space where everyone can contribute - but not everyone should be making decisions.

Design is not about what one likes. It's about what works.

And while Figma looks simple, making design decisions is not.

### Slide 19
Thank you for accompanying me on my journey of testimony about frustration with tools, feigned simplicity, and unexpected love for Figma.

Maybe it was a little therapy...

...but at least I didn't have to pay $50 a month for Adobe.
