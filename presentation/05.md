# Simplicity not simlification

### Focus on important things
Simplicity is about focusing on what matters, not stripping everything away. Every design element should have a purpose.

### Key Idea
True simplicity feels effective and clear.

*Simplicity isn’t about having nothing, it’s about purpose* **- P.J. Grillo**
